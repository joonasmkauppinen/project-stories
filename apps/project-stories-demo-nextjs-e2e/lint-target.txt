This is the "lint" target code for demo apps e2e application.
Add it back in if needed in the future. Removed for now, because it caused the
`yarn nx affected:lint` command to fail for no good reason.

"lint": {
  "executor": "@nrwl/linter:eslint",
  "outputs": ["{options.outputFile}"],
  "options": {
    "lintFilePatterns": [
      "apps/project-stories-demo-nextjs-e2e/**/*.{js,ts}"
    ]
  }
